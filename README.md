## Installation

To get StudyBuddy up and running, you will need components and a Raspberry Pi Pico W (WiFi capable).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tfozo/studybuddy.git
cd studybuddy
```

Now, copy all the files in this directory to your Pico, including the *lib* folder (assuming that you have already installed CircuitPython version 8 on your Pico using Thonny).
